    "<b> 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs? </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Answer: </b> Python and other programming languages offer this flexibility to use a set or block of code repeatedly as per requirement. Functions is this set or block of self-contained code which can be called upon as and when required. For example in python, the `print()` command is a function which is called up whenever we want to print something in a console. By use of Functions, our code becomes easier to handle. It allows me to break down the main task into several sub tasks (where each task can be executed by use of a function). This way, I can minimize the probability of errors in my program and focus on the main goal of the program. If I come across a problem during execution of the program, I can visit the relevant function and debug the code."

For example a function can calculate an area of triangle whose base and height are given as parameters of that function.A return statement causes the execution to leave the current sub program and return to the main code. The return value or statement can never contain an  expression. However a return value can be part of an expression. Please refer example below:\n"

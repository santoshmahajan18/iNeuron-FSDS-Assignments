    "<b>1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Answer:</b> shutil.copy() is a method that is used to copy the contents of a file from one file to another file/folder. It takes two arguments: `src` and `dest`. `sr`c represents the file to be copied where as `dest` destination refers to the file/folder to where the src data should be copied. If dest is a folder name, the src with exact name will be copied to the dest folder. If its a file then the contents of src will be copied to dest where dest will retain it's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "shutil.copytree() function is used to copy the entire contents of a folder to other folder. It also takes two arguments: src and dest. It copies all the content recursively and stores it in dest. The important catch here is dest must not exist prior to this and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times of directories are copied with shutil.copystat() and individual files are copied using shutil.copy2() by default which can be modified using copy_function attribute."

    "<b>3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Answer:</b> Shutil module provides a funciton called as `shutil.rmtree()` which deletes a directory and all its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are os.remove() -> removes a file, os.rmdir() removes a empty directory. However, the problem with these functions is that once a file is deleted, it will be lost permanently. If a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this limiation, we use send2trash module. It provides a function called `send2trash.send2trash()` to delete a file/directory. This method moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them. Hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally, it can be still recovered from trash folder. If it is deleted using the send2trash.send2trash() function. `send2trash` is not included with python standard libary like os and shutil modules. It needs to be installed explicitly using the command !pip install send2trash."

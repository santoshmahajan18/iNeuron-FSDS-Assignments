    "**Iterator:** In Python, an iterator is an object used to iterate over iterable objects such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. An object is called iterable if we can get an iterator from it or loop over it. Iterators are implemented using a class and a local variable for iterating is not required here, It follows lazy evaluation where the evaluation of the expression will be on hold and stored in the memory until the item is called specifically which helps us to avoid repeated evaluation. As lazy evaluation is implemented, it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced the need to load the entire dataset at the same time will not be there.\n",
    "Using an iterator-\n",
    "\n",
    "* iter() keyword is used to create an iterator containing an iterable object.\n",
    "* next() keyword is used to call the next element in the iterable object.\n",
    "After the iterable object is completed, to use them again reassign them to the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generators:** It is another way of creating iterators in a simple way where it uses the keyword “yield” instead of returning it in a defined function. Generators are implemented using a function. Just as iterators, generators also follow lazy evaluation. Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they won’t store the entire sequence in the memory."

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list.\n",

    "* List comprehension can be used together with if condition as replacement of filter method. Map function has no such functionality. However, we can feed the map function output to the filter function.  \n",

    "* List comprehension execution is faster than that of map function when the formula expression is huge and complex. \n",
    "* Map function is faster than list comprehension when the formula is already defined as a function earlier. So, that map function is used without lambda expression. \n",
    "* List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all even numbers in range of 40, we can write [n for n in range(40) if n%2 == 0]. There is no alternate for it in map"

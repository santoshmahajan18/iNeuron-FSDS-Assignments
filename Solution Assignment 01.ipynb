The other type of information that can be stored in a variable is: integer, float, complex number. A string is differentiated from other variables by use of single quote or doube quote. For example: \"India\" is an example of string."

Whenever we want to execute an expression, we type it in the prompt and the python interpreter evaluates and gives us the result or value of the result. Whereas a statement is a set of code which either creates or defines a variable or displays a value. For example a print function is a statement which prints whatever the user asks it to.

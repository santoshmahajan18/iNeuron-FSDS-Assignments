    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** `def` statement is used to create a normal function. Whereas `lamba` expressions are used to create Anonymous functions. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement. \n",

These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in python’s runtime environment. Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations. They take life when interpreted by third party libraries, for example, mypy.\n",

    "5. Avoid using digits while choosing a variable name.\n",
    "6. Try to use a name for the function which conveys the purpose of the function.\n",
    "7. Local variables should be named using camelCase format `(ex: localVariable)` whereas Global variables names should be using PascalCase `(ex:GlobalVariable)`. \n",

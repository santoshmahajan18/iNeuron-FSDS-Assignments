    "# 1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Answer:<b/> \n",
    "    \n",
    "Computer programs often represent a color in an image as an RGBA value. An RGBA value is a group of numbers that specify the amount of red, green, blue, and alpha (or transparency) in a color. Each of these component values is an integer from 0 (none at all) to 255 (the maximum). These RGBA values are assigned to individual pixels; a pixel is the smallest dot of a single color the computer screen can show (as you can imagine, there are millions of pixels on a screen). A pixel’s RGB setting tells it precisely what shade of color it should display. Images also have an alpha value to create RGBA values. If an image is displayed on the screen over a background image or desktop wallpaper, the alpha value determines how much of the background you can “see through” the image’s pixel.   \n"

    "#### 2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Answer:<b/> \n",
    "    \n",
    "In Pillow, RGBA values are represented by a tuple of four integer values. For example, the color red is represented by (255, 0, 0, 255). This color has the maximum amount of red, no green or blue, and the maximum alpha value, meaning it is fully opaque. Pillow offers the function: ImageColor.getcolor() which helps to get the RGBA values for the colors that I wish to use. This function takes a color name string as its first argument, and the string 'RGBA' as its second argument, and it returns an RGBA tuple."

    "\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "Image pixels are addressed with x- and y-coordinates, which respectively specify a pixel’s horizontal and vertical location in an image. The origin is the pixel at the top-left corner of the image and is specified with the notation (0, 0).\n",
    "Many of Pillow’s functions and methods take a box tuple argument. This means Pillow is expecting a tuple of four integer coordinates that represent a rectangular region in an image.  The four integers are, in order, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Left: The x-coordinate of the leftmost edge of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Top: The y-coordinate of the top edge of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Right: The x-coordinate of one pixel to the right of the rightmost edge of the box. This integer must be greater than the left integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bottom: The y-coordinate of one pixel lower than the bottom edge of the box. This integer must be greater than the top integer.\n",
